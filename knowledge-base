Consultative Selling Techniques

What is consultative selling?

In consultative selling, the sales professional learns about customer needs before talking about a product or solution. Product knowledge is transformed into a tailored solution that is positioned based on the customer’s needs.
For successful consultative selling discussions, focusing on avoiding being seller-centric, embracing authenticity, leading the conversation with a plan, building decisive momentum,using insights through questioning, understanding the buyer's behavioural psychology, and working from facts not assumptions.
In the next section, we explore these 7 key behaviours in greater detail.
 
1. Avoid Being Seller-centric
Many sellers believe they’re customer-focused, but few truly are. Sales professionals facing pressure to close often resort to seller-centric behaviours to try to strong-arm customers or gloss over concerns. However, these behaviours erode trust.
Sellers need to understand the person in the other chair. Doing so means forming an accurate diagnosis of their problem. This insight improves the seller's ability to effectively position solutions and build trust with the customer.
2. Embrace Authenticity
Sales professionals must give before they get. Prioritise solving the buyer’s business challenges early in the process to foster openness.
This openness helps sellers more accurately diagnose their buyer’s challenges, stated needs, and unknown needs. Using this information, the seller can show the buyer the right data to reach a resolution.
3. Lead the Conversation with a Plan
A direct approach that starts the conversation with a clear intent helps sellers gain an early indication of the buyer’s expectations. If the intended path isn’t aligned with the buyer’s goals for the conversation, the seller can adjust accordingly.
4. Build Decisive Momentum
Sales professionals can guide the buyer through the dialogue by eliciting feedback. This helps them get a sense of how well they understand the solutions and ideas discussed.
This periodic checking develops commitment incrementally throughout the buying process. It also builds decisive momentum in which alignment with the buyer makes each successive decision easier than the last.
5. Demonstrate Insights through Questioning
Asking progressively smarter questions helps the buyer connect the dots with a line that traces to the best solution.
Insightful questions quickly get to the core issues and enable the seller to float ideas. Buyers will be more open to thinking differently about solutions when the concepts are presented as questions.
6. Understand Buyer Behavioural Psychology
Buyers are human beings, and human beings have three fundamental needs for well-being that affect how they perceive what is happening, what they listen to, and how they ultimately make decisions.
These needs are Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness. Strong questioning skills help sellers respect these needs by staying emotionally connected with the buyer, avoiding coming across as manipulative, and creating a safe environment to discuss challenging or sensitive issues.
7. Work from Facts, Not Assumptions
Anchoring is a form of cognitive bias where a person relies too heavily on one piece of information. Inexperienced sellers usually anchor to their own assumptions rather than seeking out the facts through dialogue.
Anchors can cause sales professionals to miss valuable information that could advance the sales process by positioning a more compelling solution.
To counteract anchoring, the best sellers use active listening to “tune into” new or conflicting information. They aren’t afraid to ask tough questions because they know that the facts will lead to the most compelling value proposition.

● A full breakdown relating to annual site fees & the payment terms (i.e. what % is taken annually, monthly
etc…). We will also need confirmation as to whether these are renewed throughout the year or at a specific
time of the year.
We may require further financial information (such as internal management accounts) and are only able to consider
well established & reputable companies of this nature.
Transportation Services (Taxi and Private Hire)
This vertical can be riskier in terms of fraud, reputation and credit risk. To help ensure we properly underwriter these
merchants we will require the following as standard:
● A copy of their personal or operators licence
● Confirmation of types of service they offer and associated lead times (e.g. airport runs, general pick up)
● Confirmation of how many vehicles they operate
● Is the merchant self employed on behalf of a taxi company and where exactly the terminal will be located
● Explanation on how they advertise to the public
● If can’t be clearly seen online a picture of the taxi showing any stickers/licence details
Undertaker, Funeral & Crematories
We are able to consider this type of merchant however they will be subject to a credit review and further checks.
For a complete application we will need to understand what % of the card turnover relates to deposits / upfront payments &
how far in advance, on average, they are taken.
Please note, we have no appetite for payments relating to funeral plans or instalments.
We are only able to review applications for well established and reputable merchants of this nature. We may check to
validate that the merchant is a member of the NAFD so it would be worthwhile checking this and adding notes onto the
application before submitting.

Section 4: Online Checkout
This section refers to when merchants that require an online gateway whereby they will be able to take payments online
or remotely.
For Online Checkout through the merchant’s website, there are a number of characteristics that are scheme
requirements that must feature on the website in order for the site to be fully compliant to take online payments.
These are as follows:
● The full Legal Entity details must be displayed on the website (For a Limited Company this could be either the
full Limited Company name, or the full Limited Company registration number)
● Personal Contact details
● Terms & Conditions Page(s)
● Privacy Policy Page(s)
● Refund Policy Page(s)
● Visa & Mastercard Logos (Required by the Schemes to be shown)
Please note the underwriters will be unable to approve any online checkout requests from merchants, where any of
the characteristics are missing.
In instances whereby underwriters are unable to access this information or reach the secure checkout page for a
merchant’s website, they may additionally request a test login, or suitable screenshots which show a walkthrough of
how a customer would pay for a good/service via the website in question.
Alongside the compliance piece for online checkout, these payments most likely carry lead times for the services
offered. As such, we also require the following information to be submitted through:
- The % card turnover split between payments coming through the physical Dojo terminal(s) and the % that they
would expect to come through the website via online checkout
- We would need to understand if they take any deposits, payments in advance or full payments upfront for any of
the goods or services on the website and state what the associated lead times are for each offered

Section 5: Pre-check Process
In order to help reduce the friction for prospective merchants, we invite you to raise a Precheck prior to asking a customer to
complete the Dojo application form. This way, Underwriting can give you a decision as to where a business can be taken
forward for a full review.
Please note that if applications are passed at the pre-check stage by underwriters for a full review, this does not guarantee
approval.
In order to follow this process effectively we’d ask that you complete the below table and email the information to
underwriting@paymentsense.com.

Section 6: Prohibited Businesses Exceptions Process
What we mean by Prohibited
As per the Dojo Merchant Acceptance Guide, there are a number of business verticals considered to be Prohibited for
our business. This means that in general we will not look to board these merchants onto our Dojo platform for one of
the following reasons:
- Concerns with legality or compliance of the goods, services or merchant.
- Reputational Risk
- Credit Risk
- Fraud Risk
- Card Scheme Compliance
Occasionally, depending on the vertical and the reason it’s considered outside of our risk appetite, an exception may
be possible. In general this would be because you deem the commercial opportunity is worth the risk and an
exception.
NOTE: For a large number of verticals no exception may be sought. We can only review a merchant under a vertical
we’ve prohibited for subjective risk appetite reasons, such as credit risk. We will not be able to consider any requests
for goods or services that may be considered illegal or non-compliant.
Applying for an Exemption
To apply for an exemption you will first need to seek approval from your Sales Manager in writing. It’s important they
are supportive of the request prior to it being presented to Risk for consideration. Once obtained this email can be
forwarded to underwriting@paymentsense.com with the following information:
Email Subject line: Exception Request - [INSERT VERTICAL] [INSERT MERCHANT LEGAL NAME]
In the body of the email:

Dojo is a trading name of Paymentsense Limited. Copyright ©2020 Paymentsense Limited. All rights reserved. Paymentsense Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA FRN 738728) and under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (FCA FRN 900925) for the issuing of electronic money and provision of payment services.
Our company number is 06730690 and our registered office address is The Brunel Building, 2 Canalside Walk, London W2 1DG.
Reason Exception is being requested: Add detail to demonstrate you understand the merchant, their business vertical,
and what they wish to take payments for, any lead times etc. Also make it clear why you believe an exception should
be granted for this merchant.
Additional/Supporting Information: Capture any other information you believe is relevant and supportive of your
request. Please make sure this information is clear and accurate.
Attachments: You may also include any relevant information by attachment. This could be bank statements, switcher
statements, credit files.
Making a Decision
An underwriter will acknowledge receipt of your email and let you know if additional information is required to process
your request. Once they are satisfied they have enough information they will write up the case and make a
recommendation to a committee of Risk, Legal and Compliance senior team members. The case will be carefully
reviewed and a decision will be rendered. Expect one of the following outcomes:
- Approval: You may proceed with the application.
- Approval with conditions: You may proceed only if the merchant is willing to agree to set conditions.
- Further information required: We may identify specific information we need to properly review the request.
- Decline: We are not supportive of granting an exception and so the merchant cannot be boarded to Dojo.
- Lapse: The application will be cancelled. This is either actioned on request of the PC, due to a material error
being present where a new application will need to submitted or where the KYC has expired.
You will receive a detailed response letting you know the outcome and what further steps are needed if any.
Appeal Process
We are not supportive of appeals. Once a decision has been reached it will have already been reviewed by a number of
senior members of the team and so there is no value in having the same application reviewed twice. For this reason
we encourage you to include all the relevant and accurate information on the original request, as no further
information will be considered after this point.
